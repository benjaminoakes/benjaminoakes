üëã Hi, I'm Ben (he/his)

I'm a software engineer, primarily writing in Ruby.  (Try out the "small tech" cloud I'm working on, [CloudBreak](https://cloudbreak.app/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=benjaminoakes-readme&rby=benjaminoakes-readme)!  Or consider [sponsoring](https://buymeacoffee.com/benjaminoakes) ‚ù§Ô∏è)

Other passions, in no particular order:

- Open source
- Tech communities
- The web as hypertext and an application platform
- Iowa City
- Sustainability
- A hopeful future (e.g., Star Trek)
- Parenting
- Language acquisition
- American Sign Language
- Video games
